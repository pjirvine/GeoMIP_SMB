# GeoMIP_SMB

This code produces the figures shown in Irvine et al. (2018) "Brief communication: Understanding solar geoengineering's potential to limit sea level rise requires attention from cryosphere experts"

The GeoMIP data is in theory available from the ESGF nodes but due to problems with the CMIP5 archive I had to contact individual modeling groups to generate this dataset. Please email me at p.j.irvine@gmail.com if you'd like to arrange a transfer of the data and for an explanation of how to edit the code to work on your own machine.
