# GeoMIP_SMB
Please email me at p.j.irvine@gmail.com if you'd like to arrange a transfer of the data and for an explanation of how to edit the code to work on your own machine.
The GeoMIP data was downloaded from the ESGF nodes but also from individual modeling centres due to problems with the CMIP5 archive.
